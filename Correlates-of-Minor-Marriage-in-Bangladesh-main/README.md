# Correlates of Minor Marriage in Bangladesh

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes the determinants of early marriage among women in Bangladesh using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019 dataset. The goal was to identify key socio-economic and demographic factors influencing early marriage patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** UNICEF MICS 2019 (Bangladesh)
- **Size:** ~64,000 observations
- **Type:** National household survey data

## ðŸ›  Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Removing missing values, recoding variables, handling categorical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Descriptive statistics & visualization (R, Power BI).
3. **Modeling** â€“ Logistic Regression to estimate the effect of socio-economic variables.
4. **Visualization** â€“ ggplot2 & Power BI dashboards for interactive insights.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Rural residence, lower education levels, and lower wealth index are significant predictors of early marriage.
- Urban women with higher education show substantially lower risk.
- Policy implication: Interventions should focus on rural education programs.
